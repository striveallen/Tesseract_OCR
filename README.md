# Tesseract_OCR

#Version 1.0

#About

This project complete the picture OCR automatic recognition.

Tesseract OCR lang file (tessata/eng.traineddata) was trained using this Gist script file and a License Plate font.

#Requirements:

**Tesseract 4.0(x64) and leptonica-1.76.0 libraries.**

**Visual Studio 2015**

#Installation

You should have the following folder structure:

**Load the path of the bin file into the system environment variable.**

#Usage

Here is the default workflow to extract text from an image:

Instantiate Tesseract with data path and language

Set variables (character set, â€¦)

Set the image to analyze

Start recognition

Get recognized text

Clear


#Improvements

Improve image processing.

Improve square (plate) detection.

Perspective transform (or 3D).

Improve contour detection algorithm.

Improve ROI license plate area.

Better image crop.
